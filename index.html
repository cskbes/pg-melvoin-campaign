Dear <strong>Board Member Melvoin</strong>:

As your District 4 constituent and Broadway Elementary parent, I am writing to express my strong opposition to the District's decision to remove Principal Garmon from our school. I believe this decision is misguided and will ultimately harm our school and the children. <strong>More troubling, this appears to be a transparent attempt to scapegoat Principal Garmon for the District's own systemic failures.</strong>

Principal Garmon has demonstrated unwavering dedication throughout her 10+ year tenure and possesses irreplaceable understanding of Broadway Elementary's unique dual language immersion programs. <strong>The District seems determined to ignore a fundamental truth</strong>: the complicated dynamics between our programs have existed for over 10 years---long before her leadership. She has skillfully navigated these complexities despite District constraints, including following a UCP complaint filed only six weeks into her principalship.

<strong>Replacing Principal Garmon will exacerbate, rather than resolve, the underlying issues</strong> she inherited from LAUSD decisions over the years. <strong>This decision represents a failure of leadership at the District level</strong> and takes the easy path of removing a dedicated principal. <strong>Removing Principal Garmon would devastate the school, continue LAUSD's longstanding pattern of neglect toward Broadway, and inflame existing tensions.</strong>

<strong>The District needs to find a real solution to Broadway's systemic challenges, but removing our principal is not it.</strong> As our elected representative, I urge you to advocate for reconsidering this decision and instead direct the District to work collaboratively with Principal Garmon to address the systemic issues that face our school. <strong>Your leadership for our District 4 community is crucial at this moment.</strong>

Sincerely,
